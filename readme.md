# 🍷 Wine Quality Predictor

## Problem Statement

Predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties, including alcohol content, acidity, and
pH levels, to help winemakers and consumers make informed decisions.

Wine quality assessment is important for producers and consumers to ensure product satisfaction and market competitiveness. Traditionally, wine quality is evaluated through expert tasting, which can be subjective, time-consuming, and costly.

This project aims to build a machine learning model to **predict the quality of red wine** based on its physicochemical properties (such as acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol level, etc.). The goal is to classify whether a wine is of **good quality** or **not** with reasonable confidence, enabling faster and more objective quality control.

## Project Overview

A machine learning project that predicts whether a red wine sample is of **good quality** or **not** based on its physicochemical properties. The project includes:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model training using a Random Forest classifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Saving the trained model for future predictions
- A Streamlit web app for user-friendly wine quality prediction with confidence scores and feature comparison against ideal values

## Usage

### Data Analysis & Model Training

Run the `wine_quality.py` script to:

- Explore the dataset
- Visualize feature distributions and correlations
- Convert wine quality to a binary target (`good_quality`)
- Train a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluate the model performance
- Save the trained model and ideal feature values for later use

### Predicting Wine Quality (Streamlit app)

1. Open the Streamlit app.
2. Enter wine features (e.g., acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol) within suggested ranges.
3. Click **Predict Quality**.
4. View the predicted wine quality class (Good / Not Good) with confidence.
5. See a detailed comparison of your input features against ideal values, with suggestions to improve quality.
